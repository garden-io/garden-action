# Garden Github Action

This action installs garden and can optionally be used to run any [Garden](https://garden.io) command, for example `deploy`, `test` or `run workflow`.

Garden combines rapid development, testing, and DevOps automation in one tool.

This action will perform the following steps:

1. Download Garden from the GitHub release artifacts for the given version (default latest) at [garden-io/garden](https://github.com/garden-io/garden)
2. Verify the SHA256 checksum
3. Export garden to the `PATH`, so it can be used from any scripts in the following steps of the GitHub Action job.
4. If the `command` option is provided, it will run the given garden command.

   If the `command` option is *not* provided it will only prepare garden, which means it will install Garden and export it to the `PATH` environment variable. It will also export the `GARDEN_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable `garden-auth-token` is configured.

   This is helpful when calling `garden` in scripts from one of the following steps.

**Note:** At the moment this action only works with Linux-based GitHub Action runners.
If you are using macOS or Windows runners and need this action, please open a GitHub issue â€“ in case there is demand, we will rewrite this action to make it platform-independent. (We also accept Pull requests for rewriting this Action in Typescript)

## Inputs

## `command`

**Optional** The Garden command to execute, including all options. For example `deploy`, `test`, `run workflow` etc.

If not provided, the garden-action will
- install garden and export it to the `PATH` environment variable for subsequent steps
- export the `GARDEN_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable for subsequent steps if the `garden-auth-token` input has been provided

For the full documentation please refer to the [Garden CLI documentation](https://docs.garden.io/reference/commands).

## `garden-version`

**Optional** Garden version. Default is latest

## `garden-auth-token`

**Optional** A token to authenticate to Garden Cloud.

The secret will be [masked to prevent accidental exposure in logs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#masking-a-value-in-log).

**If no command has been supplied, the action will expose this value to the the following steps in the GitHub Action job by exporting a `GARDEN_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.**

## `garden-workdir`

**Optional** A path to a garden project in a repository.

Only necessary if there are multiple garden projects in a repository or if the `project.garden.yml` is in a subdirectory.

## `github-token`

**Optional** This token will be used to authenticate to GitHub API for fetching the latest Garden release. Defaults to `${{ github.token }}`.

The secret will be [masked to prevent accidental exposure in logs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#masking-a-value-in-log).


## Outputs

The garden-action does not export any outputs.

## Example usage

This example uses the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action beforehand to authenticate to AWS. This might look different with other cloud providers.
It deploys a preview environment for other team members/teams to explore and tests the latest pushed code in a separate ci environment. In the ci environment, some additional variables are used.
